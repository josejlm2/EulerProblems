Hi, welcome to my repository of the Euler Problems. Feel free to to
share and discuss this repository with me or with anyone since I feel like 
individual's work and discussions get lost in the website's forums. I have 
work through the problems without help and I'm sharing my work here.
HOWEVER, please don't use my work to cheat through the website or claim 
credit where it is not deserve. The most important part of learning
is the journey, not the destination.
